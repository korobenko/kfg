                    <h3>Merchant app (assume iOS and Android, include design cost)</h3>
                    <p>The merchant (bar owner) has a tablet with the app installed. This app receives and displays drink order information, table information (table number, seat number), and whether or not it is a cash order (all other orders are PayPal/Visa/MC or Bitcoin). An indicator is shown when a
                        cash order has not been paid. When the drink has been served and the cash has been recorded, the merchant taps the indicator to close it. This is the “merchant” app.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Consumer app (assume iOS and Android, include design cost)</h3>
                    <p>The customer sits down at a table with a mat on it. Each seat place has a mat with a unique QR code on it. This is the place where the drink will be ordered, paid for, and delivered to. The customer downloads and installs the app (if not already installed) on their smart phone. The first step for the customer is to scan the QR code on the mat using their app. They can now see the menu. After selecting their drink from a list, the customer confirms the order and pays.</p>
                    <p>The customer can scan their credit card (just as with Uber) to store card payment details and complete the payment via PayPal (same as Uber). The customer can also pay using an installed Bitcoin wallet, which will be opened automatically by the application. The merchant sees the order and payment, and makes and delivers the drink. A cash payment option may be available, and the merchant would be paid when the drink is delivered.</p>
                    <p>An option would be available which would extend credit to the consumer (a “tab”) that has scanned a credit card. The customer’s credit card would be charged automatically after a certain amount of time, or when the customer chooses to manually close their tab.</p>

                    <p>The concept is very similiar to this service: <a href="http://www.orderella.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.orderella.co.uk/</a></p>
